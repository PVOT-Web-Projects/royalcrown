  description: `Crown Decorâ€™s Interior cladding compact laminate stands as a high-density, resilient material
carefully designed for wall cladding and other interior applications where strength, aesthetics,
and easy maintenance take precedence. Fashioned by compressing multiple layers of kraft
paper saturated with phenolic resin under intense heat and pressure, this self-supporting
laminate eliminates the need for additional backing or substrate. Its top surface features a
decorative layer that expertly replicates various materials such as wood, stone, and metal, or
showcases modern abstract designs and solid colors.`,
